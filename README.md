# memoryCard-Game
Memory Card Game.


Approach:
Create a basic structure for you games using the HTML tags like div, heading, paragraph, img etc. with the particular Classes and Ids associated with each one of them.
Now, select the elements with the help of class and id CSS selectors to style the elements and make the UI attractive and interactive.
After HTML and CSS, its time to get all the required elements inside the JavaScript code and apply logic on them.
In JavaScript, we will create an array of objects with the image link, respective alt value and ID for each item of the array.
In the next part, a callback function will be created to handle the click event of the cards. This function will handle the card flips whether the flipped card is same or different by removing and ading the classes to the elements.
Next, another callback function will be created to handle the Restart Game button click, it will shuffle all the cards and flip them backward again to restart the game.
At the end, we will check for the condition where game ends and show the result to the user by using the window.alert() method of JavaScript.
